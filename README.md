# Project Description

This project includes all of my major assignments for CSc130 at CSU, Sacramento. The goal is to implement concepts from data structures and algorithms to create a functioning game level by the end of the semester. Our professor, Matthew Phillips, gave us a small portion of his game engine as a starting point. The rest is up to us. The assignments, which were assigned throughout the course of the semester, will be referred to as checkpoints from now on. [See about exporting .jar projects for each checkpoint] Each checkpoint will be labeled in the commit history of this repository, and any files changed will be labeled at the top of the respective file. A description of each checkpoint will be listed below:
 
# Checkpoints

## CP1: Import the game API, change the 2-D coordinates of the sprite
### Specifications
  The requirements for this assignment are to:
  1. Place Persephone somewhere in the bottom right quadrant of the screen
  2. Draw a text string consisting of your name below Persephone in a custom color of your choosing


## CP2: Create a vector-type object and use java queues to move the position of the sprite across the screen
### Specifications
  The requirements for this assignment are to:
  1. Load your custom sprite (128 x 128) into the game engine using Art.txt
  2. Make your sprite appear when running the program
  3. Write the Vector2D class using the template
  4. Load your frames into the first Queue
  5. Using a timer, two Vector2D queues, and your custom engine, make the image move from the left side of the screen to the right. Once the image reaches the end of the 
       animation, it should reset by transferring the second Queue back to the first
